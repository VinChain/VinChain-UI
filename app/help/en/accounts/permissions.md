# Permissions

In VinChain, each account is separated into

* **Active Permission**: control over its funds and
* **Owner Permission**: control over the account.

Both can be defined in the `Permissions` tab of your account using so called
*authorities* (see below) together with a so called *threshold* that has to be
exceeded in order for a transaction to be valid.

## Authorities

In VinChain an *authority* consists of one or many entities that authorize an
action, such as transfers.
